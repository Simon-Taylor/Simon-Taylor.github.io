            <h2>The Great Convergence: How AI Is Reshaping Product and Engineering</h2>
            <p class="blog-meta" style="color: var(--text-secondary);font-size:0.98rem;margin-top:-1rem;margin-bottom:2rem;">By Simon
                Taylor &middot; Published February 2025</p>
            <p>For most of the history of modern software development, product and engineering have existed as distinct — but complementary — functions.</p>
            <p>Product decided what should be built.</p>
            <p>Engineering decided how to build it.</p>
            <p>That division made sense. Software delivery was constrained by the difficulty of writing, testing and deploying code. Engineering capacity was scarce, expensive and slow to scale, so organisations optimised around it. Product teams prioritised demand; engineering teams executed supply.</p>
            <p>But even before AI, the boundary between the two disciplines had already begun to blur.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>A Convergence That Started Before AI</h3>
            <p>Over the past decade, product and engineering roles have gradually moved toward each other.</p>
            <p>You can see it structurally:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The rise of the CPTO role, combining product and technology leadership.</li>
                <li>Engineering managers becoming increasingly product-focused.</li>
                <li>Product managers and owners becoming far more technical.</li>
                <li>Agile teams collapsing traditional handoffs in favour of shared ownership.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This wasn't accidental. It reflected a deeper truth: building software has never been a clean separation between what and how. Decisions about architecture influence product capability. Product decisions influence technical complexity and cost.</p>
            <p>The overlap was always there. Organisations were simply formalising reality.</p>
            <p>AI hasn't created this convergence.</p>
            <p>It has accelerated it dramatically.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>The Shift Nobody Is Quite Saying Out Loud</h3>
            <p>Much has been written recently about the so-called "SaaS apocalypse" — the idea that AI will fundamentally disrupt the economics of software.</p>
            <p>Underneath the headlines is a simpler change.</p>
            <p>We are moving from:</p>
            <p>Teams of humans augmented by AI</p>
            <p>to:</p>
            <p>Small numbers of highly capable humans directing teams of AI agents.</p>
            <p>The implication is profound.</p>
            <p>The limiting factor in software delivery is no longer primarily the ability to produce code.</p>
            <p>Modern models can already generate, refactor, test and document software at a speed that would have seemed implausible even 18 months ago. When used well by experienced engineers, tokens increasingly behave like scalable engineering capacity.</p>
            <p>The return on investment is no longer linear with headcount. A small number of senior engineers, effectively orchestrating AI systems, can now produce output previously requiring entire teams.</p>
            <p>And when a constraint disappears, something else becomes the bottleneck.</p>

            <h3>Engineering Was Always Pattern Application</h3>
            <p>Software engineering has long carried an implicit truth that practitioners recognise but rarely state openly:</p>
            <p>Very little software development involves inventing something fundamentally new.</p>
            <p>Most engineering work is the application of established patterns to a specific context:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Known architectural approaches</li>
                <li>Familiar integration patterns</li>
                <li>Reusable infrastructure practices</li>
                <li>Standard testing and deployment models</li>
            </ul>
            <p>AI happens to be exceptionally good at pattern application.</p>
            <p>As a result, many aspects of building the thing right — correctness, structure, tests, documentation, even deployment scaffolding — are rapidly becoming closer to solved problems.</p>
            <p>Not perfectly solved. But increasingly automated.</p>
            <p>And when building the thing right becomes easier, attention shifts elsewhere.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>The Bottleneck Has Moved</h3>
            <p>Historically, delivery slowed down at engineering:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Writing the code</li>
                <li>Testing it</li>
                <li>Deploying it safely</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Today, that constraint is weakening.</p>
            <p>The new constraint is deciding what should exist in the first place.</p>
            <p>In other words, the bottleneck has moved from engineering to product.</p>
            <p>This is why many of the most effective AI-enabled engineers today look increasingly like product managers. Their work is less about typing code and more about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Defining problems clearly</li>
                <li>Framing outcomes</li>
                <li>Iterating rapidly on intent</li>
                <li>Validating whether the result actually solves something meaningful</li>
            </ul>
            <p>They are specifying systems rather than constructing them manually.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Building the Right Thing vs Building the Thing Right</h3>
            <p>Software delivery has always balanced two responsibilities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Building the right thing — understanding customer problems and value.</li>
                <li>Building the thing right — engineering quality, scalability and reliability.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Historically, engineering dominated organisational attention because it was the harder constraint.</p>
            <p>AI is flipping that balance.</p>
            <p>As execution becomes cheaper and faster, mistakes in what you choose to build become vastly more expensive than mistakes in how you build it.</p>
            <p>You can now build the wrong thing faster than ever.</p>
            <p>Which makes product judgement the scarce resource.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Where Human Value Moves Next</h3>
            <p>AI doesn't eliminate human contribution. It relocates it.</p>
            <p>For now, the highest leverage human work sits increasingly in product thinking:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Problem framing</li>
                <li>Value identification</li>
                <li>Trade-off judgement</li>
                <li>Contextual understanding</li>
                <li>Validation of outcomes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The engineers operating most effectively in this environment are not disappearing — they are evolving into hybrid product-engineering operators.</p>
            <p>The pendulum is swinging away from execution and toward intent.</p>
            <p>And that shift has happened remarkably quickly. Much of it has emerged in just the last twelve months — and arguably accelerated again in the past six, as agentic workflows and more capable coding models have matured.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>The Real Implication</h3>
            <p>This convergence doesn't mean product replaces engineering.</p>
            <p>It means the distinction matters less.</p>
            <p>The future team may not look like separate product and engineering functions collaborating across a boundary. Instead, it looks like a small number of deeply experienced individuals defining outcomes and directing increasingly capable AI systems to realise them.</p>
            <p>Software development becomes less about writing code and more about deciding what deserves to exist.</p>
            <p>For organisations, this creates a new strategic question:</p>
            <p>If building software is no longer the primary constraint, are you optimised for deciding the right things to build?</p>
            <p>Because in an AI-accelerated world, that decision is where most of the value — and risk — now lives.</p>
